<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a hands-on DevOps learning project covering the full toolchain—from local Flask app development to deployment on Cloud Foundry. This project explores and integrates key DevOps tools and concepts including CI/CD, infrastructure as code, cloud deployment, and automation pipelines. Built to provide end-to-end exposure to real-world DevOps workflows. It enatils a basic sentiment analysis project built for predicting the sentiment of restaurant reviews. It uses an SVM model that is built using Python's scikit-learn and nltk libraries. The model has been saved and stored in the Models folder inroot directory. A CI/CD pipeline has been built to integrate multiple DevOps project to create an end-to-end flow of the working, deployed application.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To run this project, make sure the public IP provided by ngrok is active. If so, trigger the Jenkins build by making a change in the repo. Once the build has completed and the app has been deployed, use [this link](https://apppy-happy-antelope-yr.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/sentimentAnalysis) to navigate to the application.

### Basic Workflow

Initially, a Jenkins pipeline is trigerred on changes being pushed to the repo. After the successful completion of the pipeline, new changes are pushed to the repo and GitHub actions triggers the deployment. A ‘main.yml’ file is defined, where scripts have been written to perform different jobs (Check, Deploy and Notify) for deployment.
